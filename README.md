## Nukem Ipsum Generator

I grew up during the Cold War, and I've only recently begun learning of the nuclear weapons and devices that
surrounded me in various locations where I've lived.  It's not like the threats of World War III have
entirely gone away, but they seem less likely today to break out between Russia and the US.

Still, there has been a long evolution of technology in the background.  Some would say that winning the Cold
War was actually the reason for the technology push.  I say it's but one of the reasons, but not the only
one.  Still, staying ahead or at least even has been important.  And it's been enlightening to begin to learn
about the details of the technology of nuclear weapons.  And sobering.
