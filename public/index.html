        <h1 class="title">Nukem Ipsum Generator</h1>

        <p class="description">

            A simple nukem ipsum generator. Unlike many ipsum generators, this one uses complete sentences.
            These sentences come from training and repair manuals that are now declassified, public domain
            treaties, such as SALT I and SALT II, famous quotes, and of course, various movies about nuclear
            war, such as <i>Wargames</i>, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, <i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i>,
            <i>The Hunt for Red October</i> and several James Bond movies. There's even a quote about Bert the
            turtle from the <i>Duck and Cover</i> movies shown to us young children in the 60s.
